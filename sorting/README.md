# Sorting

## Overview
Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are used to arrange elements of an array or list in a particular order (ascending or descending). Efficient sorting improves performance in searching, data organization, and algorithm optimization.

## Key Concepts

- **Divide and Conquer**: Many efficient sorting algorithms (like Merge Sort and Quick Sort) use this approach.

- **Stability**: Whether equal elements maintain their relative order.

- **Time Complexity**: Varies by algorithm and scenario (best, average, worst cases).

- **Space Complexity**: Some algorithms are in-place, others require extra memory.

## Common Problems

- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort

## Time & Space Complexities of Merge Sort
| Operation	    | Complexity   |
|---------------|--------------|
| Best Case	    | O(n log n)   |  
| Average Case	| O(n log n)   |
| Worst Case	| O(n log n)   |
| Space	        | O(n)         |
