## 🎯 What is Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic Programming (DP) is an algorithmic technique that solves optimization problems by breaking them into smaller, overlapping subproblems.

### 🔑 Principles

1. **Optimal Substructure** – optimal solutions are built from subproblems
2. **Overlapping Subproblems** – same subproblems appear multiple times
3. **Memoization** – store results to avoid recomputation

---

## 🏗️ DP Approaches

* **Top-Down (Memoization)**: Recursive + cache
* **Bottom-Up (Tabulation)**: Iterative + build up table

---

## 📊 Common Patterns

* **Linear DP**: Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs
* **2D DP**: LCS, Edit Distance
* **Interval DP**: Matrix Chain Multiplication
* **Tree DP**: Maximum Path Sum
* **Digit DP**: Count numbers with constraints

---

## 📚 Problems by Level

**Easy**: Climbing Stairs, Fibonacci, House Robber
**Medium**: Best Time to Buy/Sell Stock, Coin Change, LIS, Unique Paths
**Hard**: Edit Distance, Max Subarray Product, Word Break II

## 🧠 Problem-Solving Strategy

1. Identify if it’s a DP problem
2. Define state (parameters needed)
3. Write recurrence relation
4. Implement → recursive → memoized → tabulated → space-optimized
5. Analyze complexity

## 💡 Tips

* Always define base cases carefully
* Optimize space with rolling arrays
* Debug by printing DP table for small examples
