This document curates a comprehensive set of questions on tree data structures, focusing on traversals, binary trees, BST operations, height and diameter calculations, and interview-style problems. Questions are organized by category for clarity and future expansion.

## Basic Concepts

   Explain the definition, properties, and real-world applications of trees. Provide a suitable example.

2. **What is a Binary Tree?**  
   Describe the structure of a binary tree, including root, nodes, leaves, and the maximum number of children per node. Provide a suitable example.

3. **Types of Binary Trees**  
   Discuss full binary trees, complete binary trees, perfect binary trees, balanced binary trees, and degenerate trees. Provide a suitable example.

4. **Tree Terminology**  
   Define terms like root, parent, child, sibling, leaf, subtree, height, depth, and level. Provide a suitable example.

5. **Applications of Trees**  
   List common applications such as file systems, databases (B-trees), expression parsing, and decision trees. Provide a suitable example.

## Traversals

6. **Inorder Traversal**  
   Implement and explain inorder traversal (left-root-right) for a binary tree. Provide both recursive and iterative solutions.  
   **Example**: Tree: 1 (root), left: 2, right: 3; 2's left: 4. Inorder: 4, 2, 1, 3.  
   **Hint**: For recursive, visit left subtree, then root, then right. For iterative, use a stack to simulate the recursion.

7. **Preorder Traversal**  
   Implement and explain preorder traversal (root-left-right) for a binary tree. Provide both recursive and iterative solutions.  
   **Example**: Tree: 1 (root), left: 2, right: 3; 2's left: 4. Preorder: 1, 2, 4, 3.  
   **Hint**: For recursive, visit root, then left subtree, then right. For iterative, use a stack starting with root.

8. **Postorder Traversal**  
   Implement and explain postorder traversal (left-right-root) for a binary tree. Provide both recursive and iterative solutions.  
   **Example**: Tree: 1 (root), left: 2, right: 3; 2's left: 4. Postorder: 4, 2, 3, 1.  
   **Hint**: For recursive, visit left subtree, then right, then root. For iterative, use a stack and process children before root.

9. **Level Order Traversal**  
   Implement level order traversal (breadth-first) for a binary tree.  
   **Example**: Tree: 1 (root), left: 2, right: 3; 2's left: 4. Level order: 1, 2, 3, 4.  
   **Hint**: Use a queue to process nodes level by level, enqueue children as you dequeue parents.

10. **Zigzag Level Order Traversal**  
    Modify level order traversal to alternate directions per level (e.g., left to right, then right to left).  
    **Example**: Tree: 1 (root), left: 2, right: 3; 2's left: 4, 3's right: 5. Zigzag: [1], [3,2], [4,5].  
    **Related Problem**: Given a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal as a list of lists.

11. **Morris Traversal**  
    Implement inorder traversal without recursion or stack, using threaded binary trees (Morris method).  
    **Example**: Tree: 1 (root), left: 2, right: 3; 2's right: 4. Inorder: 2,4,1,3.  
    **Related Problem**: Implement preorder Morris traversal.

12. **Boundary Traversal**  
    Traverse the boundary of a binary tree: left boundary, leaves, and right boundary.  
    **Example**: Tree: 1 (root), left: 2, right: 3; 2's left: 4, right: 5; 3's right: 6. Boundary: 1,2,4,5,6,3.  
    **Related Problem**: Print the boundary in anti-clockwise direction.

14. **Diameter of a Binary Tree**  
    Find the diameter (longest path between any two nodes) of a binary tree.  
    **Example**: Tree: 1 (root), left: 2, right: 3; 2's left: 4, right: 5. Diameter: 4 (4-2-1-3 or 4-2-5).  
    **Hint**: The diameter is the maximum of left height + right height + 1, or the diameters of subtrees. Compute heights and diameters in one pass.
